# Offline Neural Machine Translation API

This project provides a FastAPI backend for performing offline neural machine translation (NMT) and interacting with a local Large Language Model (LLM). It includes functionalities for translation, LLM text generation, system monitoring, and glossary management.

## Features

-   **Offline Translation**: Translate English to French using a pre-trained Opus-MT model.
-   **LLM Text Generation**: Interact with the CroissantLLMChat-v0.1 model for text generation based on prompts.
-   **Glossary Management**: Upload, retrieve, replace, and clear a custom CSV glossary to influence LLM responses.
-   **Model Management**: Check model loading status, trigger model reloads, and monitor download progress.
-   **System Monitoring**: Get real-time information on CPU and memory usage.

## Models Used

-   **Translation**: `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr` (and `opus-mt-tc-big-en-fr` is referenced but not actively used in the provided code).
-   **LLM**: `croissantllm/CroissantLLMChat-v0.1`

Models are downloaded and loaded asynchronously on application startup.

## Setup

To set up and run this project, you'll need Python 3.8+ and `venv` for managing virtual environments.

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m venv venv
# On Windows (Command Prompt)
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# On Windows (PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
